Make sure to put all the files in the same folder, and then run the Mancala Overlay file in a Python IDE. You should then be able to create a Queen AI who you can play against. Version 0 just uses minimax, Version 1 uses alpha-beta pruning. You can make both player objects in your control, both be AI, or play against the AI's. You can also choose the lookahead, i.e. the amount of moves they look ahead in the game. For version 0 the amount of time it takes to move in a reasonable time, like a minute or less, is when the lookahead is less than or equal to 8. For version 1 it's around 13 or so.
